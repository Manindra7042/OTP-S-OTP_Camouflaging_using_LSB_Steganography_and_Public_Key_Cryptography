# OTP-S-OTP_Camouflaging_using_LSB_Steganography_and_Public_Key_Cryptography
the data is ciphered with a novel algorithm of asymmetric key cryptography and then the ciphered message is camouflaged in the cover media using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography technique. Even if the intruder cracks the LSB algorithm used here, he will get the encrypted data since the source data is not present on the cover media. To obtain the original data, the ciphered data must be deciphered with the deciphering algorithm. With the additional security, it is impossible to crack the original data from the cover media
